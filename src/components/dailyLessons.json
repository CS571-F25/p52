The Honmoon is a concept created for the movie but takes inspiration from Korean shamanism. Korean shamans, or mudang (무당), are said to be able to open the boundaries between realms for spirits.",

For example, the demon hunters, like the mudang, have to bring people together and can influence the boundaries between realms. Moreover, the weapons that Huntrix uses are inspired by ceremonial blades used in shamanic rituals. Finally, demon hunters also seem to be traditionally women.\n\nEven in real life, K-pop performances and shamanic rituals have been compared. \"[R]hythm, repetition, and emotional intensity\" are important to both K-pop performances and shamanic rituals. It is said that both roles require being \"born with the saju (사주), or spiritual constitution\".",

It was historically one of the few ornaments that could be worn across all social classes (though lower class women wore simpler norigae than upper class women), and was often a treasured heirloom passed down as a wedding gift.\nEach norigae is different, expressing an individual’s taste, identity, social status, and wishes. Possible wishes represented in norigae include good luck, protection, longevity, prosperity, and the hope for many children. Despite each norigae’s individuality, they share similarities, being each composed of a main ornament (paemul 패물), intricate knots (maedeup 매듭), tassels (sul 술), and a hook (ddidon 띠돈) for attaching the norigae. A norigae can have a varying number of pendants, with one pendant (danjak 단작) and three pendants (samjak 삼작) being the most popular.\nThe Huntrix members wear norigae during their “How It’s Done” performance. Rumi’s norigae has a Gajipangsok knot, which symbolizes abundance and continuity. Mira’s norigae has a butterfly knot, which symbolizes transformation and beauty. Zoey’s norigae has a chrysanthemum knot, which symbolizes longevity and good fortune.",

The string attached to the gat is called a gatkkeun (갓끈). The gatkkeun can be decorated with beads of various materials, which helps weigh the gat down.\nThe gat reflects one’s social status and represents wisdom and dignity. Unlike in the west, where it is polite to remove your hat, it was considered respectful to keep your gat on. The gat was typically worn by men, especially noblemen, during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897 or 1392-1910, depending on the specification) — the time in which Jinu would have lived. The Saja Boys each wear a black gat, or heukrip (흑립), when they are first introduced and during their “Your Idol” performance.",

On the other hand, when pronounced with a long vowel (使者), saja means \"envoy\" or \"messenger.\" In particular, jeoseung saja (저승사자) literally means \"underworld messenger.\" In Korean mythology, there are multiple jeoseung saja, each of whom record the names of the deceased and guide souls to the afterlife. They are not inherently malevolent spirits but instead maintain the cosmic balance—in some folktales, a jeoseung saja may display compassion and offer a few more moments of life. They all serve King Yama (or Yeomra-daewang 염라대왕), the King of the Underworld, who determines a soul’s fate after death. The jeoseung saja are usually depicted as men, each of whom wear a gat (갓), a traditional Korean hat that reflects their status as entities performing official duties. The Saja Boys similarly each wear a gat (갓). Like the two meanings of saja, the Saja Boys have a dual nature — the false, bubbly side they show during \"Soda Pop\" and their true, darker side they reveal during \"Your Idol.\"",
