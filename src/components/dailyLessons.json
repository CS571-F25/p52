The Honmoon is a concept created for the movie but takes inspiration from Korean shamanism. Korean shamans, or mudang (무당), are said to be able to open the boundaries between realms for spirits.",

For example, the demon hunters, like the mudang, have to bring people together and can influence the boundaries between realms. Moreover, the weapons that Huntrix uses are inspired by ceremonial blades used in shamanic rituals. Finally, demon hunters also seem to be traditionally women.\n\nEven in real life, K-pop performances and shamanic rituals have been compared. \"[R]hythm, repetition, and emotional intensity\" are important to both K-pop performances and shamanic rituals. It is said that both roles require being \"born with the saju (사주), or spiritual constitution\".",
