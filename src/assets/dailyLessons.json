For example, the demon hunters, like the mudang, have to bring people together and can influence the boundaries between realms. Moreover, the weapons that Huntrix uses are inspired by ceremonial blades used in shamanic rituals. Finally, demon hunters also seem to be traditionally women.\n\nEven in real life, K-pop performances and shamanic rituals have been compared. \"[R]hythm, repetition, and emotional intensity\" are important to both K-pop performances and shamanic rituals. It is said that both roles require being \"born with the saju (사주), or spiritual constitution\".",

Possible wishes represented in norigae include good luck, protection, longevity, prosperity, and the hope for many children. Despite each norigae’s individuality, they share similarities, being each composed of a main ornament (paemul 패물), intricate knots (maedeup 매듭), tassels (sul 술), and a hook (ddidon 띠돈) for attaching the norigae. A norigae can have a varying number of pendants, with one pendant (danjak 단작) and three pendants (samjak 삼작) being the most popular.\n\nThe Huntrix members wear norigae during their “How It’s Done” performance. Rumi’s norigae has a Gajipangsok knot, which symbolizes abundance and continuity. Mira’s norigae has a butterfly knot, which symbolizes transformation and beauty. Zoey’s norigae has a chrysanthemum knot, which symbolizes longevity and good fortune.",

The gatkkeun can be decorated with beads of various materials, which helps weigh the gat down.\n\nThe gat reflects one’s social status and represents wisdom and dignity. Unlike in the west, where it is polite to remove your hat, it was considered respectful to keep your gat on. The gat was typically worn by men, especially noblemen, during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897 or 1392-1910, depending on the specification) — the time in which Jinu would have lived. The Saja Boys each wear a black gat, or heukrip (흑립), when they are first introduced and during their “Your Idol” performance.",

They are not inherently malevolent spirits but instead maintain the cosmic balance—in some folktales, a jeoseung saja may display compassion and offer a few more moments of life. They all serve King Yama (or Yeomra-daewang 염라대왕), the King of the Underworld, who determines a soul’s fate after death. The jeoseung saja are usually depicted as men, each of whom wear a gat (갓), a traditional Korean hat that reflects their status as entities performing official duties. The Saja Boys similarly each wear a gat (갓). Like the two meanings of saja, the Saja Boys have a dual nature — the false, bubbly side they show during \"Soda Pop\" and their true, darker side they reveal during \"Your Idol.\"",

The saingeom is a ceremonial sword used in traditional Korean shamanic rituals (called gut 굿 rituals), protecting the people against spiritual evils rather than being used in battle. Hence, the blade is only sharpened at the front and is made of soft iron. It is also decorated with auspicious symbols and constellations in silver or gold.\n\nAdditionally, the saingeom is rare, because it is forged during the tiger year (In-nyeon), tiger month (In-wol), tiger day (In-il), and tiger hour (In-si), an alignment that occurs about once every 60 years. In Korean cosmology, four tigers protect the four cardinal directions, and it was believed that a sword made with stronger tiger energy had more of the positive spiritual power called Yang. Thus, the saingeom was considered the strongest spiritual weapon, as compared to the other types of ingeom (인검), or \"tiger sword\".\n\nThe saingeom originates from the Joseon Dynasty, during which it symbolized the authority of the royal family and was even used by kings during shamanic rituals.",
